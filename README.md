Programming Assignment:
<br/>
Create a game using C++ object oriented programming. 
The game is played as follows. The player throws two discs on a two dimensional grid. The player wins if the discs overlap. The discs must be thrown randomly.
<br/>
Assume when a disc is thrown its center is always on integer coordinates. For
example, a center may be at (2,4), where 2 is the x-coordinate and 4 is the y
coordinate.
<br/>
Your program prompts the user to specify the radius of the first disc and then the radius of the second disc. 
<br/>
The discs are representedby objects. 
<br/>
Then your program prompts the user to “throw” the discs. 
<br/>
Finally, the program displays the radius of the two discs, their center coordinates, and whether the user won the game or not. 
<br/>
Your program must use C++ class or classes. 
<br/>
Any C++ classes you create must not have any public data members
